# Experimental design summary:

No replicates (probably), total of 83 mixtures, 1299 metabolite standards.

Each lab will run these twice, one times with a lab specific set up and one
time with a harmonized method.

Harmonized method:

-   Lhe harmonized method provide specific column, specific data acquisition
    time.
-   should be an inclusion list
-   MassSpec set up will be lab dependent even in the harmonized protocol
-   Essentially it is an harmonized lc set up

Here is [example of
metadata](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pbu6TpgGqK5jL36E_GHRUSubD0DRlmw-/edit?gid=53750153#gid=53750153)
We will get this from each lab.

Naming codes are as such:

-   Lab: HMGU = A, AUTh = B, ICL = C, CEU = D, Afekta = E.
-   Harmonized method = 1, laboratory method = 2.

There will be NAPS, we could use them for:

-   rt shift alignemnt
-   to normalise intensity maybe. Within and accross labs...

The mixtures will be run in in batches :

-   Human endosome
-   Food exposome
-   Chemical Exposome & Microbiota Exposome & Eukaryotic Exposme & Plant
    Exposome

Aims for ions :

-   Positive: \[M+H\]+ and \[M+Na\]+
-   Negative: \[M-H\]- and\[M+FA-H\]-

Fragmentation can also be studied later on:

-   How ?

The peaks similarity code can later be used for grouping method in the
`MsFeature` package

# Study Aims:

General aim is to understand the variation that arises due to lc-ms set ups
difference.

# Possible analysis:

Mains

-   Determine difference within labs harmonized vs. lab specific technique
    -   this gives us the LC variation
    -   Could we use the NAPS here to get an estimation of rt shift ?
-   Determine between harmonized of different labs.
    -   this gives us difference due to MS

Others:

-   Compare the presence of different adducts between systems
-   Fragmentation (We should have collision energy information also...)

# Steps:

-   Preprocess all labs one by one
    -   Same settings for the harmonized method across labs.
    -   Specific setting for the lab specific method.
-   Generate results summary for both methods in each
    -   Number of standard present for each method
        -   Summarize per exposome, polarity,.. ?
-   Use these summary for inter and intra lab analysis:
    -   Intra-lab:
        -   For the standards present in both methods, compute, peak shape
            similarities, peakwidth, possibly intensity.
        -   Check for polarity based difference, mass-based idfference,
            exposome based difference.
    -   Inter-lab (only look at harmonized set up)
        -   Compare number of standard, adducts,..
        -   If possible (enough overlap) make a list of common adducts and then
            compute peak shape, intensity,.. similarities.
