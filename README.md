# HUMAN_Ring_Trial
This repo is to group the analysis of the Ring trial study which is part of the HUMAN doctoral network main studies.

The study is defined as such: 

Within HUMAN, we would like to understand better where the differences between different
LC-MS setups used for metabolomics come from. Therefore, different setups are compared
using different methods. First, each participating laboratory uses a specific method in “daily”
laboratory business. Second, a standardized method using the same column and gradient is
used. Therefore, a total of 83 mixtures will be analyzed twice: by a “HUMAN reference method”
and by a lab specific method.
In the first step for comparison of the methods and laboratories, mixtures obtained from the
MetaSci metabolite standard library are measured. Since the ground truth (number and
identity of metabolite) is known, we can compare the different chromatographic methods within
a laboratory and compare the different LC-MS setups from different laboratories using the
standardized method.
